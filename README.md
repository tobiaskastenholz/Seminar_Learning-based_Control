# Seminar Learning-based Control
Seminar about Learning-based Control at RWTH Aachen University (Winter Semester 2020/2021) 

__Course description:__

The use of machine learning and artificial intelligence has huge potential for building
future engineering systems. Learning-based control is a recent and very active area of
research that addresses these challenges, and broadly denotes the intersection of the
areas of automatic control and machine learning.

Some topics we would like to cover in this seminar:
1. Gaussian Processes for dynamics and control
2. (Deep) Reinforcement learning
3. Structured/Hybrid modeling
4. Verification for learning based contro

Goals:
1. To be able to search, read and understand international, English language
research literature.
2. Understand and explain research problems and their solution.
3. Present the state of the art of research in written and oral form in English.
4. Relate the big picture to the details of a technical topic.

Deliverables:
1. Paper on the chosen topic (6 pages excl. references).
2. A review on 2-3 papers of your peers.
3. Presentation of 20 minutes plus 10 minutes Q&A.

You have to hand in a __six-page review paper__ that contains:
1. Some background on the broader topic of your paper, incl. helpful references.
2. The state of the art on the more specific problem, incl. helpful references.
3. The main contributions and methods used to solve the problem.
4. A discussion of the presented results.
5. The paper should be written using Latex.

This repo contains the review paper that I delivered in the seminar. I was graded with a 1.0 (1.0 highest, 5.0 lowest).

__Assigned paper:__

- Title: A Lyapunov-based Approach to Safe Reinforcement Learning
- Author: Yinlam Chow et al.
- Keywords: Safe Reinforcement Learning
- Link: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07708
- Synopsis: This paper is about Realizing safe reinforcement learning by
  constructing Lyapunov functions. On this paper we want to focus on The
  general idea of safe Reinforcement Learning and how it is realized here. We
  expect that the student to present the high level idea of safe RL and embed the
  paper into this context
